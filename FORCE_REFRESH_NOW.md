## 💡 Why This Happens:

Browsers cache HTML/CSS/JS files for performance. When you update the file, the browser doesn't know and keeps showing the old cached version.

**Hard refresh** forces the browser to:
1. Ignore cache
2. Download fresh files
3. Show updated version

You'll see:
- Parallax star field
- Neon glowing icons

**It's worth the refresh - the new UI is stunning!** 🌌✨
