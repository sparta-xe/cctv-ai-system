## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Dashboard?
- Check if server is running (look for "Uvicorn running" message)
- Try http://127.0.0.1:8000 instead
- Check if port 8000 is available
- Check firewall settings

### Server Won't Start?
- Check if port 8000 is already in use
- Verify all dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version (3.8+)

### Slow Performance?
- Normal for CPU processing
- First run downloads models (takes time)
- Use shorter videos for testing
- Consider GPU acceleration for production

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### First Run
- Downloads YOLOv8 model (~6MB)
- Downloads CLIP model (~350MB)
- Takes 1-2 minutes

### Video Processing
